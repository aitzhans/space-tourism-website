        A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body
        reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our
        capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a
        space gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you
        entertained.
